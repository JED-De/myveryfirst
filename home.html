       <h3>I'm excited for this site!</h3>
       <p>
         This is my first ever website ever done! It was a bit challenge at the star because I don't know how to make a website from scratch.
         I thought of using a web-development tools such as Adobe XD or Adobe Dreamweaver but if that's the case it wouldn't be as fun as making it from zero.
         All of here I made with Atom, a place where you can make html and css programs. I was considering VS Code but typing there was not as fast as typing in Atom,
         I think it atom it made easier with the shorcuts.

       <p>
         The only problem I encounter with atom is just with its simplicity. Sometimes Atom doesn't give suggestions like VS Code, we have to manually write the code in it.
         Also the color coding of the functions is very different with VS Code, but I think this is not a very big of a problem because it's just cosmetics and not semantics.
         Atom doesn't have a lot of feature like VS Code, so actually it was meant for the advanced web-developer. Nonetheless I found Atom much more interesting than VS Code.

         Well, there you go a very little overview of my website. I wanted to make a logo for my website, but I'm not a designer, so I just slapped my nickname on the site.
